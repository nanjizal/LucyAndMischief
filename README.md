Lost on - 26 March 2024 at 7pm.
Lost at Rosemary Lodge Vet's carpark.
  
Escaped on trip to Vet for flu jabs, was carrying accross carpark and the both bolted and the door of the cat carrier box opened and they ran off.
They were not used to travelling in a car nor being confined to a cat carrier box.

They are friendly cats that do not bite of scratch but only used to me. When I arrive home they normally roll on the drive with happyness but often avoid being picked up. The often sleep on me at night. They are outdoor cats so can hunt a little.
